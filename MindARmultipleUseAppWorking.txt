Merge multiple images into one .mind file
https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile

Attach seperate anchor to each index of the .mind file

Use the onTargetFound method of the anchor to set a variable to true

Depending on which variable is true .play() that action

Yeah create separate action for each variable


OR

create 4 varianles with same gtlf model
and use 1 variable for 1 anchor
